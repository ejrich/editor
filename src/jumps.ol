// When jumps are recorded:
// - Opening new buffer, record current jump to line 0, cursor 0
// - Swapping to buffer, record current position
// - Jump to top/bottom of buffer
// - Next/previous search result
// - Next/previous paragraph/sentence
// - Next/previous syntactical char (Need to implement this)
